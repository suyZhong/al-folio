I was a team member of USTC-Software in 2019 for international Genetically Engineering Machine (iGEM) competition. We developed software for biologists to help them do experiments more easily. Our project won a gold medal and nominated for the best software.

We've traveled to Boston for final presentation. Boston is beautiful, and I had a very wonderful memory there.
