I am a senior undergraduate in the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://en.cs.ustc.edu.cn/) at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/). I will join [NUS](https://nus.edu.sg/) as a Ph.D. candidate in Fall 2022.

My Chinese given name is Ê∫ØÈ£è (Su Yang), pronounced as Ê∫Ø/s ä/ È£è/j ån/. My family name is Èíü (Zhong). To pronounce it, just change <b>zone</b> /z…ô än/ to /d í…ô än/. (It's also how my domain name came from üòã )

My research interests include software engineering and program analysis. For more information please see my <a href="CV">CV</a>.
