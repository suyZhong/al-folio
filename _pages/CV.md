### Education


##### University of Science and Technology of China <span style="float:right;">Sep 2018 - 2022</span>

- Bachelor of Engineering, majoring in Computer Science and Technology
- Overall GPA: 3.67/4.3
<br/><br/>

### Experience

<!-- <h5 class="category"> Bachelor Thesis (In progress) <span style="float:right;">Oct 2021 - Present</span> </h5>

- Study of Membership Inference Attack on Deep Learning Models
- Supervisor: Prof. <a href="https://sunjun.site/">Jun Sun</a> at Singapore Management University and Prof. <a href="https://yinxingxue.github.io/">Yinxing Xue</a> at USTC
- Develop tools and methods to bound the accuracy of membership inference attack. Aim to verify the difference of output distribution of models trained by adjacent datasets is less than the threshold. Use influence function to measure the influence of training samples on the model, and use attack
accuracy as a criterion to measure the risk of training samples.

<h5 class="category">  Summer Research Intern <span style="float:right;">July 2021 - Aug 2021</span></h5>

- Evaluation of an HTAP database
- Supervisor: Prof. <a href="https://i.cs.hku.hk/~heming/">Heming Cui</a> at HKU
- Deploy an HTAP database system (TKDE18â€™-Janus) on the servers, and test on the YCSB benchmark and CH-benchmark. Implement a new client for CH-benchmark, sending transactions to row and column servers.


<h5 class="category">  Innovation Course Project <span style="float:right;">Sep 2020 - Jan 2021</span></h5>

- Cminus-F builder -- Course project of Principles and Techniques of Compiler.
- Instructor: Prof. <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengli7/">Cheng Li</a> at USTC
- Complete a cminus-f compiler using flex and bison, including the kernel function of a compiler front-end, and some optimization, e.g. const propagation. Finish extra optimization tasks, e.g. dynamic dead code elimination.


<h5 class="category">  Undergraduate Research Program <span style="float:right;">June 2020 - Sep 2020</span></h5>

- Study influencing factors of neural network pruning strategy
- Supervisor: Prof. <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~bhua/">Bei Hua</a> at USTC
- Based on a mainstream model (YOLOv3) in object detection research, reproduce a pruning method (Network Slimming) and train new pruned models on different datasets. Choose 3 datasets of different degrees of complexity, and study the influence of datasets on pruning strategies for object detection task.
